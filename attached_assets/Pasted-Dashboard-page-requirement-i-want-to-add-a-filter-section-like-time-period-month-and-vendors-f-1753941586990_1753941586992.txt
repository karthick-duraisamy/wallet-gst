Dashboard page requirement :

i want to add a filter section like time period, month and vendors field and apply button as attached in the image.
Remove the this month dropdown in the dashboard page.
Also, can improve the dashboard details designs (All Travel History, Airline Invoices, All Invoices, Net Claimable Amount(INR)) like a modern dashoard designs
Below invoice details there is no download option, only there is a option like all airlines (Change the seperate 2 dropdown, this is not the dropdown ) i have attached image.
And in the same invoice details you have mention type as seperate dropdown and invoice as seperate dropdown (Both are same type is the label name and dropdowns are invoices count and amount).
same for Airline wise claimable Amount(INR) - Remove the dropdown and add some airline name in the airline dropdown
Airlines pending files to GST :
Type dropdown add options like amount and invoices count
Add some airline name in the airline dropdown
Upload page requirement :

Can improve the upload page design, its not looking good
Add some animations while upload the file (Like loading and tick mark)
DOnt occupy the full width of the page for upload box reduce the width
can also improve the completed file design also
Cumulative / Reconciliation requirement :

Pagination design can modify i have attached the image for pagination dont modify for go to page or display page only pagination design change
If i click filter in the list below its showing some error solve that and if i click the filter its should open a headers as option like supplier name, PNR tickets etc.. on that i'll choose which header to display and not give in a checkbox.
Reset all button should reset all the data in the filters
Reconciliation history (Airline) requirement :

In status field there is a count showing remove that and display them outer with the moder style design like All 76, new 0 etc..
change Start / End Date and add a date range
Add travel vendor option like cleartip, makemy trip etc..
Cumulative Invoice (Airline) requirement :

Upload multiple pnr / Ticket no design is very bad fix that issue
